To launch the project you have to execute this command:

```bash
   ng serve
```
&nbsp;
(you need to have installed **[angular-cli](https://cli.angular.io/){:target=_blank}**.

Angular will build and package the application but it'll not open our browser...so you have to open the browser and write the following URL: _http://localhost:4200_
